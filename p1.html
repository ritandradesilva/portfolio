            "If Flachau is a tourist town, especially at this time of the year,
            and if most people are only here temporarily, then soon there will
            be a McDonald's near us."
          </p>
          <p>
            The minus20degree festival "interprets the existing winter landscape
            as a laboratory for all expressions of art". And the Social Design
            department at the University of Applied Arts Vienna, which I’m part
            of, was invited to participate.
          </p>
          <p>
            We were asked to create interventions that would somehow raise
            questions about Flachau's development and snow tourism environmental
            and social effects, (Flachau has about 2900 habitants, in 2019 had
            over 1.3 million overnight stays, mostly for winter sports tourism).
          </p>
          <p>
            My idea was to, instead of criticizing the current situation,
            suggest one small change in the near future and see how the locals
            and tourists would look at it. And I thought the Mcdonald's logo,
            with all the environmental and ethical weight it brings, would get
            some reactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sign with the chosen sentence, "soon near us", was placed in an
            empty area in the main street and was meant to be interpreted not
            only as an announcement of a new (fictitious) construction, but also
            as a reminder that most of us are only there temporarily. Could even
            be seen as a warning.
          </p>
          <p>
            The banner got some reactions and generated some opinions, as
            intended. Mayor Thomas Oberreiter himself commented on the
            hypothesis raised by the project, in an article dedicated to it, in
            the newspaper Salzburg Nachrichten, printed on January 24, 2022 and
