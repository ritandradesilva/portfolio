          Between March and July 2024, I was in Tokyo interning with <a
          href="https://www.naokoo.com" target="_blank" >Naoko Okumura </a> and <a
          href="https://www.isaooooo.com"target="_blank" > Isa Natsumi,</a> collaborating on their Social Design projects.
        </p><p>
          “How is 利他 in Japan” was an exhibition shown at the Portuguese Embassy in Japan and at the Mizu no Sora gallery, which documented and illustrated this experience in two parts: a professional/academic perspective and a more personal one.
        </p><p>
          The word “利他” means “altruism” in Japanese, symbolizing the community work carried out by various social action and integration companies with which Naoko's team has collaborated. Coincidentally, “利他” also sounds like my name, Rita, referring to the personal component of my experience, marked by Japanese cultural differences and generosity, evident both in the reception at all the institutions visited and at Naoko's studio and Kobushi No Ie, the care home for people with disabilities where I lived during those months.
        </p><p>
          The exhibition and all the pieces in it were produced and designed by me, and were initially divided into: “How is Altruism in Japan” and “How is Rita in Japan”. In the second edition, Naoko's team added their perspective on this experience in a third part, including illustrations, texts and animations by Isa Natsumi.</p>
